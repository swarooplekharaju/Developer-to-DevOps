# Developer-to-DevOps
from git basics to administrating the Kubernetes pods , I would like to learn and start things from scratch and see my learnings and growth here  


# Python/DevOps/SRE/cloud  Proffesor :


#### All these years I wanted to become a python proffesional and use those skills in DevOps/SRE/CLOUD but all my time I am roaming here and there for the best book or best course available in the market but I am lost in that thought . 


#### Hence I decided to learn multiple books and course and filter that knowledge and keep a notes or outline of that learning activity so that me or anyone starting with python/go lang can refer this repository and travel with the repository deploying their own project or web application or automation to aws cloud atleast trying with the available coding styles, design patterns and efficent python coding models if possible i will also try to learn and include best software architechtures in the same repository.
